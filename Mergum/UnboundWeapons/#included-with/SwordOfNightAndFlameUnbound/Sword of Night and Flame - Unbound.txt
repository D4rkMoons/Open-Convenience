Sword of Night and Flame Unbound

This is my third Elden Ring mod, an overhaul of the Sword of Night and Flame.
Here's the list of changes;
- Lore of weapon and ash of war changed.
- Changed damage scaling.
- Now comes with a completely new moveset, which replaces the Straight Sword moveset.
- Now comes with a new Ash of War, Equinox Onslaught, which replaces White Shadow's Lure.
If you have any issues with the mod, let me know.

IMPORTANT NOTE

This goes for this mod and all of my past and future mods; I do not intend for my mods to be merged with anyone elses but my own. I will not edit the mod specifically to be compatible with a mod that is not my own. I only write the TAEs and things just as a reminder to myself for convenience. If you wish to play any of my mods with another mod that isn't compatible with mine, do not ask me to edit it personally for you, and just do it yourself.
