IMPORTANT NOTE

This goes for this Modpack and all of my past and future mods; I do not intend for my mods to be merged with anyone elses but my own. I will not edit the mod specifically to be compatible with a mod that is not my own. I only write the TAEs and things just as a reminder to myself for convenience. If you wish to play any of my mods with another mod that isn't compatible with mine, do not ask me to edit it personally for you, and just do it yourself.
