国内玩家朋友也可以直接在采蘑菇免费下载：艾尔登法环 - 【卡利亚复合骑士】动作MOD - 踩蘑菇社区 (caimogu.cc)
需要查看MOD展示可以观看我的B站视频：歇洛克的烟斗的个人空间_哔哩哔哩_bilibili

The MOD here is a combination of multiple moveset changes, aiming at creating more combos for weapons; parry, dodge, guide chase available as you wield them
properly, and provide some comlexity of magic and weapon attack behaviors. 
Some of the motions in the original games were changed, they would be helpful and necessary for the weapon I modified while cause some problems in other weapons, Therefore,
﻿

Backup copy of your savedata and regulation.bin are strongly recommended for using!!! 
Available on Game Version 1.09.0 only!!!


Many people reported that the attack make no damage or projectiles, that means the file "regulation.bin" is not placed correctly, or version unmatched, where u need to: 

Place the file "regulation.bin" in "mod" folder created by Modengine 2!!!
And make sure the mod version matches the game version as well!!! 


I' m fresh to MOD, if anything like Bug happens please post your problem down below, let us find out the solution together. 

..........................................................................................................

Before Using


1.        Make sure the MODhave been loaded correctly, otherwise there may be no damage; If the installment still bothers you, go check out on Youtube for MOD using guidance; As well as how to use this MOD with Co-Op MOD;
2.        It happens sometimein the game version 1.08.01 that the first time loading the MOD may invoke an warning from the main menu saying “loading ﻿ corruption”, here’ s thesolution that may help: use STEAM to start the game once and after that, use the modengine to start again; Anyway, HAVE YOUR ﻿   SAVE BACKUPED INCASE;
3.        Use the Availableweapon, recommended ones particularly, for other weapons have part of motions unfit in this MOD, which means they can still be used but not the motions listed below;
4.        In the formerversions, enchantment sorcery or incantation like Frozen Armament or Bloodflame Blade would be erased during the modded attacks,which have been fixed now thanks to my friend MURAUE;
5.        The model Hunter’spistol in the Curved Greatsword is made by Bilibili:_月见樱_(433324220), Thanksto whom the gun motions came into reality; therefore do ask her before using the gun model into your own MOD;
6.        The Talisman ----- Carian FiligreedCrest has been changes into a multi-functional one:
﻿﻿1)       Defense increasedfor 70%;
﻿﻿2)       Attack decreased for 70%;
﻿﻿3)       Weight capacityincreased for 100%;
﻿﻿4)       Bow distanceincreased for 100%;
﻿﻿5)       Aux resist increasedfor 20 points;
﻿﻿6)       Falling damageignored (yet falling from far too high still take the life);
﻿﻿7)       Skill and Sorcery FPConsumption decreased to 25% (way too OP, to be changed if next version finished)
﻿   These are changed based on my one habits, tofocus on combat itself, if you don’t like it then just don’t use this talisman;
7.        The attack typeswere edited without the thoughts of make sure how could the damage be augmented; therefore, I could not tell you how to increased your attack through other talisman, this is my fault;
8.        These Ash of Warmodified can be used on the corresponding weapon listed along, that means the motion and damage can still affect on the light and heavy attacks of weapon itself, any other AoW not modded in this MOD make difference as well; But if the AoW were installed on the wrong weapon, like Prelate's Charge with hammer, the Prelate’ s Charge would make no damage at all;
9.        Many weapon’ sstances have been changed from 2H to 1H, which will cause awkward guarding posture;
10.    Greatsword andTwinblade is recommended for a female character; However, if you want to use these two weapons as male character, check out the ﻿  “Installment Instruction” part down below;
11.    Straight sword,Katana, Curved Greatsword, Spear and Twinblade’ s special motion have been changed into the normal ones in order to have the modded motion appliable;
12.    Weight loadinfluences the dodge motion, basically all the motions refered in this instructions can be interrupted by dodge, apart from the colossal ﻿ motions and all the motions in sky; 

.......................................................................................

The skill list now is way too long and added in the MOD files now
For player who having trouble with my dizzy and stupid combo intstructions:
Here' s a wonderful instruction video made by Elite CarlosN (https://www.youtube.com/@EliteCarlosN):

So interesting and easy reading guidance that would definitely help a lot. Amazing work, Thanks!
