ONE! The parent is absolute. Their will must be obeyed.
﻿This is something I made for my game that I'm sharing for others who might want to use it.
﻿I gave the Nagakiba Owl's moves.
﻿Comes with proper sound effects (player sounds, not the Owl's).

﻿This mod requires a regulation.bin!(CSV file included)

﻿Can easily be merged with Vigil (overhaul I use), Elden Ring Reforged, whatever.
﻿You just need a basic understanding of Yapped and DSMapStudio.



TWO! The master is absolute. You give your life to keep him safe.
 


Some notes:

    I haven't added the flaming owl fireball move yet. It will be added as a standalone Ash of War later.
    Will also add idles, movement, and dodges as a standalone TAE for this moveset only later.
    The 1h rolling R1 traps humanoid enemies, stopping their movements for a few seconds. It also releases a cloud of poison that deals heavy damage to enemies that stand inside.
    Anytime you are flipping, dodging, or invisible, you have i-frames.
    THREE! Fear is absolute. There is no shame in losing one battle. But you must take revenge by any means necessary!
