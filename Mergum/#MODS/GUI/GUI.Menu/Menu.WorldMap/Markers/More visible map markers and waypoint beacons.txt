I know there is already a mod that changes these markers here on the nexus but in my opinion it doesn't make them visible enough.
I have often encountered the problem of not being able to find them on the map because they are confused with the colors of the map itself, so I thought of making this change and making it available for those who have the same problem as me.

Unfortunately I found that waypoint beacons have little space to make them different and bigger, but I have recolored them and now they are much more visible (outside the map, in the game, they will still appear in blue)
