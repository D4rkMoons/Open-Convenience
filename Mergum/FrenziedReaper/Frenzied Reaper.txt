New Weapon Frenzied Reaper
A large scythe, tormented and blistered by the Three Finger's touch. Heavy strength and faith scaling.  

New Ash of War Maddened Immolation
Leap into the air and throw the frenzied scythe forward, impacting it into the ground with violent arcs of madness bursting forth. Rush into the flames and grab the scythe, imbuing yourself with frenzy inside the explosion. While maddened, all attacks cause frenzy to burst from your eye. 





This weapon replaces the regular Scythe, found in the Cliffbottom Catacombs in Liurnia.
