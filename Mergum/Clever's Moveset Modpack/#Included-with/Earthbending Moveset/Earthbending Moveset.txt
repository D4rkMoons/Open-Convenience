Permissions and credits

Earthbending is here! 

The one-handed moveset is range-focused, with boulder throws, eruptions, and projectiles.
The two-handed moveset is a brawler moveset, with high poise and devastating rockshard attacks. 

Lavasurfing Heat up the earth's crust to generate molten lava beneath your feet, then begin surfing on the surface, generating a blistering path of destruction. Hold to continue surfing.







Where to Find It

    Earthbending has replaced the Spiked Caestus, sold by the Isolated Merchant in Dragonbarrow. 
    If you want Lavasurfing on another weapon, it can be found at the location that the Prelate's Charge Ash of War is found.



Notes

    Due to animation restrictions, this mod was built on top of my Martial Arts mod. The Earthbending weapon will have the Earthbending moveset, and other fist weapons will have the Martial Arts moveset. 
    Also due to animation restrictions, Earhbending does not have a dual-wield moveset. Please only 1H or 2H the Earthbending weapon. 
    As always, the Avatar movesets are very hard to balance. Please leave suggestions in the comments section.
