Vengeance and Glory
A holy sword and shield designed to be an unbreakable aggressive wall.
Deflect enemy magic or your own thrown discs, trapping your enemy in a righteous game of ping-pong. 

Unique Skill Vanguard's Glory
Raise your shield into a ready stance to briefly activate a holy barrier, deflecting all magic. 
Follow up with a strong attack to emit a powerful radiant explosion. Your shield blocks continuously during this skill.

The inseparable sword is gorgeous and strong, but doesn't even get a unique skill. Coupled with some weirdness in the files implying it was once a longsword, I decided to change the weapon drastically. 
Most attacks raise your shield, and have active block frames while the shield is raised 
Some attacks activate a deflect barrier, which reflects all incoming magic.
Some attacks launch holy discs - which can be bounced back into the enemy with the deflect barrier.

Once you get used to which attacks launch discs and which attack deflect, you become an unstoppable offensive wall. Hope you like it!

Known Issues
Sometimes a thin golden streak appears near the shield. Switch to one-handed then back to two-handed to make it go away.
