Another Malenia Mod
﻿This is something I made for my game that I'm sharing for others who might want to use it.
﻿I gave the katana some of ﻿Malenia's moves. Comes with proper sound effects (player sounds, not Malenia's).

﻿As of 2.0, this mod has NO requirements. This mod contains NO regulation.bin!!

﻿Can easily be merged with Vigil (overhaul I use), Elden Ring Reforged, vanilla 1.08.1, whatever. You just need a basic ﻿﻿understanding of Yapped.

Some notes
Sounds effects are med. This is the most tedious part of animation modding.
I removed as many sparksbutterflyscarlet aeonia effects from the animations as I could because I didn't like them. Some might still show up though.
