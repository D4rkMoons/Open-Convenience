Updated for Elden Ring 1.5

The parry window is the same as a medium shield (5 frames), but with much less startup delay.
You can block with any weapon to parry, not just shields.
This is for players that want to parry skillfully, but want to free their L2 button up for other ashes of war or 2-hand a weapon.



This is a commissioned mod! Thank you to the client for the great idea.
