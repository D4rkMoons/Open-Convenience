Basic but effective modification that replaces the crosshair with a more precise one.

﻿﻿Never miss again a long distance headshot with manual aiming!
Well, slightly less than before at least...


If you also include the use of the bow or crossbow in your build and also think that the basic sight does not provide great accuracy in certain contexts, especially when using arrows or darts at a great distance, I've got you covered.

Not so lore friendly and not reminiscent some kind of medieval style, but very precise and inevitable for those who use a mod which adds firearms like GUNNER CLASS (M16 and Shotgun) , Elden Ring Gun Mod Pack or more simply for those like me who do not like the basic crosshair.



﻿
With these you can take advantage of the zoom mechanics of ranged weapons even better.

Update

The user TedKuruk has kindly proposed, created and provided an alternative version of the crosshair sniper,
you can watch a small preview below and download it in the files tab, the installation remains the same as the other crosshair of course.



Thank you TedKuruk!
