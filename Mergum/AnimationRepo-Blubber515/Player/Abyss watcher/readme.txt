A repository of animations from the Dark Souls III boss Abyss Watchers, along with animations from the Ashen One's Farron Greatsword retargeted onto the player for modders to use in their own mods. As stated in the overview, this is not a mod, but merely a collection of hkx animation files, so adding it to your mods folder will do nothing. For non-modders who wish to learn how, I would recommend joining the ?ServerName? Discord for assistance, as well as visiting Rainer Gei's youtube channel, which has several videos going over the basics of DSAnimStudio, which is needed for editing events (attacks, sounds, particle effects, etc...) within animations.
Animations Included:

The names of each file correspond to their respective source animation in the Abyss Watcher's, c3040's, anibnd file, so look there in DSAnimStudio for clarification on what each animation refers to.


Farron Greatsword Animations Included:
a161_033000.hkx (Light Attack 1)
a161_033010.hkx (Light Attack 2)
a161_033020.hkx (Light Attack 3)
a161_033500.hkx (Running Attack? See note below.)
a161_033900.hkx (Roll Attack)
a161_036000.hkx (Cut Stomp Weapon Art Start)
a161_036050.hkx (Cut Stomp Weapon Art Thrust)

Note: While there's an entirely separate  animation for the running attack in the files, DSAnimStudio suggests that the game does not use this, and instead just uses the first light attack animation for its running attack. There is also a separate parry animation, but it looks no different visually from any other shield parry, so I saw no reason to include it.
