First things first, this is NOT a mod, but rather a resource for modders with the knowledge to use it for their own mods.

A repository of animations from various characters across the Souls series retargeted onto the player for modders to use in their own mods. As stated in the overview, this is not a mod, but merely a collection of hkx animation files, so adding it to your mods folder will do nothing. For non-modders who wish to learn how, I would recommend joining the ?ServerName? and Meowmaritus Zone﻿ Discord servers for assistance, as well as visiting Rainer Gei's youtube channel, which has several videos going over the basics of DSAnimStudio, which is needed for editing events (attacks, sounds, particle effects, etc...) within animations.

Thanks to f wang for packing everything (that has been released up to 4/6/2023) into one anibnd!

Nioh 2 Fist Animations (HUGE thanks to The Witness for providing the animations and naming the files, along with Angel Dasha for providing files that packs them all in one TAE)



This list will be updated whenever I add a new repository to this page. While not every single animation is included, I will at the very least try to include all of the animations for any given character's walking/running cycle, Idles, attacks, dodges, and grab attacks.
The names of each file correspond to their respective source animation in any given character's anibnd file, so look there in DSAnimStudio for clarification on what each animation refers to.

c4720 Disclaimer: Unlike most enemies, Godfrey is left-handed, and therefore attempting to use his animations on a right hand weapon will simply not work. To fix this, in DS Anim Studio we'll need to use an event called "WeaponModelOverrideLocation", which will allow us to override our right hand weapon to the left-handed location. Look at this video for a demonstration. For those who do not wish to do this I'll be adding mirrored versions of the animations to the Godfrey file soon.
