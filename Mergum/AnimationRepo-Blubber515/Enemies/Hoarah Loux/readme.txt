First things first, this is NOT a mod, but rather a resource for modders with the knowledge to use it for their own mods.

A repository of Hoarah Loux animations retargeted onto the player for modders to use in their own mods. As stated in the overview, this is not a mod, but merely a collection of hkx animation files, so adding it to your mods folder will do nothing. For non-modders who wish to learn how, I would recommend joining the ?ServerName? Discord for assistance, as well as visiting Rainer Gei's youtube channel, which has several videos going over the basics of DSAnimStudio, which is needed for editing events (attacks, sounds, particle effects, etc...) within animations.

The names of each file correspond to their respective source animation in Hoarah Loux, c4721's, anibnd file, so look there in DSAnimStudio for clarification on what each animation refers to. Animations with an asterisk next to them will require the "Jumptable 27: Disable Gravity" event to be added in AnimStudio in order to work properly, or your character will just be stuck to the ground for the duration of the animation.
