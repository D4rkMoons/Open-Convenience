this mod brings you both Fushigiri and Open Gate crossed on Wolf's back. this was an idea I had for a long time that I could never execute until now. This is for the Shura enjoyers wanting to have more immersion playing as Shura Wolf. I couldn't figure out the handguard material issue for Fushigiri, no matter how hard I tried, so that and that alone is missing a texture. I HIGHLY recommend using the Black Mortal Blade effects mod alongside this mod to give Open Gate proper Mortal and empowered mortal draw coloration. Special thanks to buddy97 for letting me use his Open Gate asset to make this. enjoy.
