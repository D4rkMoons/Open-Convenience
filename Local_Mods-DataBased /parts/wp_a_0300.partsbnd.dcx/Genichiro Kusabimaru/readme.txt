This mod was a request. This mod brings you Genichiro's katana, sized down to Kusabimaru size and retextured to have a black hilt with white undertones, a black scabbard, and a brighter silver blade. It's updated to 1.06 so sakura dance and all combat arts should work properly. If not, let me know and I'll fix it. I hope you enjoy )
