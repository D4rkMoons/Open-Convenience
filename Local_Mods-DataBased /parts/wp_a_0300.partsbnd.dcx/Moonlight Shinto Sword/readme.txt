--SHINTO MOONLIGHT SWORD--

This is yet another moonlight re-texture. Most of the re-textures I've seen available stay true to the original sword and it's western versions, but since this is the east, a katana needs the hamon clay finish to enhance the look of the many folds underwent during it's making. I've also added the base material as a Shinto pattern accompanied with a scabbard that has Shinto texts written on it. The final product does not do the amount of work put into it justice though, so please look in the images for the full texture map if you can D

This was an absolute blast to make. I hope you all enjoy it very much! Due to time constraints I won't be making a mortal blade version, but I'll get to it eventually )
