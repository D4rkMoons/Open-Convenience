Hey y'all. this mod brings you a version of Tanjiro's katana from Demon Slayer. I'm not done working on this as there's a couple texture issues in the handguard, but it's okay enough for now to be uploaded as it gets the essence of the katana right. this is going to be an ongoing project to bring in swords from different media, so if there's anything you can think of that you'd want in game, shoot me a message on here or drop a comment with your idea and i'll let you know if it's possible for me to do. If i can't do it, i know someone who certainly can. So keep an eye out for more swords to be added as I come up with more ideas. Much abundance y'all
