The weapon supports for Sekiro 1.06 skills. It uses owl's blade model, profectly entends your attack range.  And I have to say it actually make you game easier with longer attack range. Longer range allows you to hit your opponent before they hit you. Just think that when you play dark souls, you feel much easier to farm a map with a ultra great weapon.

No scabbard and no extra models, the reason is that I want file smaller for optimization, and models overlap when the wolf is drawing his blade from its scabbard., because the scabbard is too long to fit the drawing animation.

Requirement
Sekiro mod engine
