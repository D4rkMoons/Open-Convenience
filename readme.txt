IF there is no files, unrar(used winrar) the SFX archive
its an SFX archive(as in an .exe achive) | That contains SFX Folder 👀 WOOOOW 👌



BTW 🐧 For linux users, but every users 🤷‍You can simply rename "sfx.part1.exe" to "sfx.part1.rar", to use Winrar instead 👌
But you can also simply use Wine to execute the sfx.part1.exe and it will extract where you're wine can (i recommend not its a mess pointing to a simple location, but since your on 🐧 you should know just how it is 🙈)
